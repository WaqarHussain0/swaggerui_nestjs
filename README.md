# Swagger UI in NEST JS

## Description

This project is a NestJS application that demonstrates the usage of Swagger UI for API documentation. It provides endpoints for managing users, including functionalities such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.

## What is Swagger UI?

Swagger UI is a tool for generating interactive API documentation directly from your OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger). It allows developers to visualize and interact with the API resources without having to dig into the code. Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface for exploring endpoints, understanding request/response payloads, and testing API operations.

## Features

- **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all API endpoints using Swagger UI.
- **Create User**: Endpoint to create a new user with name and email.
- **Get All Users**: Endpoint to retrieve a list of all users or search for users by name or email.
- **Get User By ID**: Endpoint to retrieve details of a user by their ID.
- **Update User**: Endpoint to update the details of a user by their ID.
- **Delete User**: Endpoint to delete a user by their ID.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Swagger UI**: A tool for generating interactive API documentation.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm run start`.

## Usage

1. Once the server is running, access the Swagger UI documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api`.
2. Explore the available endpoints and test the API operations directly from the Swagger UI interface.
